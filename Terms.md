# Activities Terms of Service

Last updated and effective: April 1, 2022

This ToS applies to the Discord bot [Activities]()https://github.com/AnthonyVanTonder/ActivitiesBot.

You may not use Activities to violate any applicable laws or regulations, [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), or [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). You also may not use Activities to harm anyone or anything.

When using activities launched through the bot, additional terms may apply to you. These terms will typically be linked to you by Discord when you first launch the activity. For example, when using Watch Together, [YouTube's Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) apply, and when playing SpellCast, [FRVR's Terms of Service](https://frvr.com/legal/#TermsofService) apply. Do not use Activities to violate the terms of any service.

To contact me ([Anthony van Tonder](https://advaith.io)), the developer of Activities, you can mention Anthony van Tonder#2056 (`853462855784464416`) in the official [Anthony van Tonder Discord Server](https://anthonyvantonder.wordpress.com/discord).

Thanks for using Activities!
